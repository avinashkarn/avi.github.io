## Abtract 
Teosinte (*Zea mays* ssp. *parviglumis*) is the wild ancestor of modern maize (*Zea mays* ssp.
*mays*). Teosinte contains greater genetic diversity compared with maize inbreds and landraces, but its
use is limited by insufficient genetic resources to evaluate its value. A population of teosinte near isogenic
lines (NILs) was previously developed to broaden the resources for genetic diversity of maize, and to
discover novel alleles for agronomic and domestication traits. The 961 teosinte NILs were developed by
backcrossing 10 geographically diverse parviglumis accessions into the B73 (reference genome inbred)
background. The NILs were grown in two replications in 2009 and 2010 in Columbia, MO and Aurora,
NY, respectively, and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance calibrations
were developed and used to rapidly predict total kernel starch, protein, and oil content on a dry matter
basis in bulk whole grains of teosinte NILs. Our joint-linkage quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis
identified two starch, three protein, and six oil QTL, which collectively explained 18, 23, and 45% of the
total variation, respectively. A range of strong additive allelic effects for kernel starch, protein, and oil
content were identified relative to the B73 allele. Our results support our hypothesis that teosinte harbors
stronger alleles for kernel composition traits than maize, and that teosinte can be exploited for the improvement
of kernel composition traits in modern maize germplasm.
