Haploview software is a Java based open source software, developed by Broad institute at MIT for `haplotype analysis` and `LD visualization`. I recommend reading more about it at this <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview"> Link </a> for in-depth information. 
As per the documentatioin of this software, one can perform wide range of analyses such as `LD & haplotype block analysis`, `haplotype frequency estimation`, `association analysis`, and `visualization` and `plotting LD and haplotypes`. However, in this tutorial I will be showing the following key elements required to perform analyses in Haploview:

- Downloading software and its system requirements 
- Creating input files (.ped and .info)
- Importing data in Haploview
- Calcluating Haplotypes
- Exporting Haplotypes'
- Plotting LD heatmaps
- Exporting LD plots

<br>

## 1. Download Haploview and Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

Please download the software and the correct version of JAVA as per your operating system (i.e. Windows, MAC and Linux) at this link: <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/downloads"> Download Haploview here </a> 

- Haploview requires Java JRE 1.3 or later, but 1.4 is strongly recommended.
- Requires min of 128M RAM


## 2. Create input files (.ped and .info files)

Haploview takes in a wide range input file formats, however, i am going to show how to modify your data in the `Linkage Format`. Please read the haploview documentation for more details.

There two required files for `Linkage Format`: `.ped` and `.info` files. The details are below:

### .ped file

`.ped` file (Linkage Pedigree) requires the columns for `familyID`, `individualNames`, `fatherName`, `motherName`, `gender`, `affected status` and `genotypes`

__familyID__ : Individual's family name.

__individual ID__ : Genotype IDs of the progeny

__father's ID__ : Parent 1 name  or "0" if unknown father.

__mother's ID__ : Parent 2 name or "0" if unknown mother.

__sex__ : Individual's gender (1=MALE, 2=FEMALE).

__affection status__ : Affection status to be used for association tests (0=UNKNOWN, 1=UNAFFECTED, 2=AFFECTED).

__marker genotypes__ : Each marker calls in either ACGT or 1-4 format, where: 1=A, 2=C, 3=G, T=4. And 0 if missing data.


For reference, please check out the screen shot of a sample `.ped` file below.

<i class="fa fa-commenting" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** Please make sure there is NO header row as shown in the above screenshot, and its easier to modify your data in MS Excel.

<br>

### .info file

The .info file consists of two columns: `Marker names` and `Physical positions of the markers`

For reference, please check out the screen shot of a sample `.info` file below.

{: .box-note}
<i class="fa fa-commenting" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** Please make sure there is NO header row as shown in the above screenshot and its easier to modify your data in MS Excel. Also, please remember the marker order in both .ped files and .info are in same order!

## Download sample files 

Please downnload sample .ped and .info files from below links:

- <a href="/image/haploview/sample_chr4_haploviewFile.info" target="_blank">Download sample .INFO file here.</a>
- <a href="/image/haploview/sample_chr4_haploviewFile.ped" target="_blank">Download sample .PED file here.</a>


## Importing and performing analysis in Haploview

Once the .ped and .info files are ready, it can be imported by following the steps i have shown in below animation:
