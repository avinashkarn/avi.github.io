__TASSEL__ aslo known as `Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution and Linkage` is a powerful statistical software to conduct `association mapping` such as `General Linear Model (GLM)` and `Mixed Linear Model (MLM)`. The GUI (graphical user interface) version of TASSEL is very well built for anyone who does not have a background or experience in working in `command line`. In this tutorial, I will show how to prepare `input` files and run assoication analysis in TASSEL. For detailed information on TASSEL, user's guide and further documentation please visit:

<h1>1.1 Download and install TASSEL software </h1>
Download and install the latest version of the <strong> TASSEL software </strong> at this link:
`https://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel`

<hr>

<h2>1.2: Preparing the Input files </h2>
<h2> Phenotype  file</h2>
Prepare the phenotype file as shown below in the figure, and please remember if your data has `covariates` such as `sex`, `age` or `treatment`, then, please categories them with header name `factor`.

<hr>

<h2> Genotype file</h2>
TASSEL allows various genotype file formats such as `VCF` (variant call format), `.hmp.txt`, and `plink`. In this tutorial, I am using the `hmp.txt` version of the genotype file. The below githe screenshot of the hmp.txt genotype file.

<hr>

<h1> Step 1.2: Importing phenotype and genotype files </h1>
Import the files by following the steps shown below.
__Tip!__ Both files can be opened at same time holding `CTRL` and clicking the file names.

<hr>

<h2> 1.3 Phenotype distribution plot</h2>
It is always a wise idea to look at the phenotype distribution by plotting to check for any outliers. Follow below steps to plot histogram of your phenotype data.

<hr>

<h2> 1.4 Genotype summary analysis </h2>
Next crucial step is to look at the genotype data by simply following the steps shown.
Couple of keys things to look at are:
<ol>
  <li>Minor allele frequency distribution </li>
  <li>Missing genotypic data to see if it requires to be imputed </li>
  <li>Proportion of heterozygous in the samples to check for self-ed samples </li>
</ol>

<h1> 2.0 Conduct GWAS analysis </h1>

<h3> 2.1 multidimensional scaling (MDS) </h3>
MDS output can be used as the covariate in the GLM or MLM to correct for population structure.
Please follow the steps shown below:

<hr>

<h3> 2.2 Intersecting the files </h3>
Intersect the `genotype`, `phenotype` and `MDS` files by following the steps below:

<center><img src="/image/gwas/intersect.gif" alt="Intersect files"></center>

<hr>

<h1> 3.0 running General Linear Model (GLM) </h1>
Run the GLM analysis by selecting the `intersected` files following the steps below:

<center><img src="/image/gwas/glm.gif" alt="GLM"></center>
<hr>

The output of the GLM analyis is produced ubder the `Result` node. The GLM association test can be evaluated by plotting `Q-Q plot` and the `Manhattan` plot as shown below.

<img src="/image/gwas/qqplot.png" width="auto" height="200" alt="Q-Q plot">
</center>

From the above Q-Q plot, we can see that are several markers that appear to be falsely associated with the trait, therefore, to control this confounding effect, use `Kinship` matrix as an another covariate in the linear model

<hr>

<h3> 4.0 Calculating Kinship matrix </h3>
Follow the below steps to calcuate the kinship matrix.

<hr>

<h3> 4.1 running Mixed Linear Model (MLM)  </h3>
Once the Kinship matrix has been calculated, MLM can be now be conducted by below:

</center>

<h3> 4.2 Exporting results  </h3>
One may export the results in .txt format by the following the below steps:

<hr>

<h3> 4.3 Significance Threshold  </h3>
Bonferroni threshold can be deterimined to identify significantly markers associated with the trait  by using the below equation:
```
P ≤ 1/N (α =0.05)
```
where, N is the total number of markers tested in association analysis) was used to identify the most significantly markers associated with the trait. Similarly, another way is to perform `FDR` (`False Discovey Rate`) correction method.
