__ANOVA__ also known as `Analysis of Variance` is a powerful statistical method to test a hypothesis involving more than two groups (also known as treatments). However, ANOVA is limited in providing a detailed insights between different treatments or groups, and this is where, `Tukey (T) test` also known as T-test comes in to play. In this tutorial, I will show how to prepare `input` files and run ANOVA and Tukey test in R software. For detailed information on ANOVA and R, please read this article at this

<h2> Step 1.0 Download and install R software and R studio </h2>

<ol>
  <li> Download and install the latest version of the <strong> R software </strong> from this
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html"> link </a> </li>
  <li> Download and install R studio from this <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">link</a></li>
  <li> Finally, install the library <strong> qtl </strong> in R </li>
</ol>

<h1> Step 1.3: Preparing the Input file </h1>
Create an input file as shown in the example below:

<center><h1> Step 2: Run ANOVA in R</h1></center>
<hr>
<h3> 2.1 Import R package </h3>

Install R package `agricolae` and open the library typing the below command line:
```powershell
library(agricolae)
```
<br>

<i class="fa fa-commenting" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** Please remember to install the correct R package for ANOVA!

  
<hr>
<h3> 2.2 Import data </h3>

Import your data by typing the below command line:
```powershell
data= read.table(file = "fileName.txt", header = T)
```

<hr>
<h3> 2.3 Check data </h3>

Once the data is imported, check it by typing the below command line:
```powershell
head(data_pressure)
tail(data_pressure)
```

<hr>
  
<h3> 2.4 Conduct ANOVA </h3>

Now, Simply run `ANOVA` by typing the below command lines:
```powershell
data.lm <- lm(data$Dependent_variable ~ data$Treatment, data = data)

data.av <- aov(data.lm)
summary(data.av)
```
<h3> 2.5 Regression Coefficient </h3>

Obtain regression coefficient of the predictors in the data using below code:

```powershell
summary(data.lm)
```
Output -->

```console
> summary(data.lm)

Call:
lm(formula = data$Dependent_variable ~ data$Treatment, data = data)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-2.32500 -0.48500  0.05917  0.23979  2.68500 

Coefficients:
                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)       1.9383     0.4481   4.325 0.000329 ***
data$TreatmentB   2.5267     0.6338   3.987 0.000726 ***
data$TreatmentD   5.7450     0.6338   9.065 1.61e-08 ***
data$TreatmentE   5.7258     0.6338   9.035 1.70e-08 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 1.098 on 20 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8524,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8302 
F-statistic: 38.49 on 3 and 20 DF,  p-value: 1.692e-08
```
To add another coefficient, add the symbol "+" for every additional variable you want to add to the model.

<h3> 2.6 Overall model’s performance </h3>

The overall model's performane cand be obtained using the below code:

```powershell
summary(data.av)
```
Output --> 

```console
> summary(data.av)
               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    
data$Treatment  3  139.2   46.38   38.49 1.69e-08 ***
Residuals      20   24.1    1.20                     
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

<h3> 2.7 Good fit of the linear model </h3>

The coefficient of determination or R² is a good measure to test if the linear model has the good fit, and is measured by the proportion of the total variability explained by the regression model.

R² of a linear model can be obtained using below code: 

```powershell

summary(data.lm)$r.squared

```
Output --> 

```console

summary(data.lm)$r.squared
[1] 0.8523754

```
The model can explain ~85% of the total variability, which tells us that the model fits the data very well.

<h3> 3.0 Conduct Tukey test </h3>

From the summary output, one can interpret that there is a significant difference (i.e. P < 0.001) between the `Treatments`, however, we perfom Tukey's Test to investigate the differences between all treaments using steps below.

Type below commands to run Tukey test:
```powershell
data.test <- TukeyHSD(data.av)
data.test
```

Below is the summary of the Tukey test:
```console
> data.test
  Tukey multiple comparisons of means
    95% family-wise confidence level

Fit: aov(formula = data.lm)

$`data$Treatment`
           diff        lwr      upr     p adj
B-A  2.52666667  0.7527896 4.300544 0.0037260
D-A  5.74500000  3.9711229 7.518877 0.0000001
E-A  5.72583333  3.9519563 7.499710 0.0000001
D-B  3.21833333  1.4444563 4.992210 0.0003106
E-B  3.19916667  1.4252896 4.973044 0.0003326
E-D -0.01916667 -1.7930437 1.754710 0.9999897
```
<hr>

From the above T-test, one can conclude that there is a significant difference in the most of groups, except between-groups __E-D__ at P <0.001

Finally, one can plot the above results using the below command:
```powershell
plot(data.test)
```
