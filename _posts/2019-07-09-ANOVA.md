__ANOVA__ also known as `Analysis of Variance` is a powerful statistical method to test a hypothesis involving more than two groups (also known as treatments). However, ANOVA is limited in providing a detailed insights between different treatments or groups, and this is where, `Tukey (T) test` also known as T-test comes in to play. In this tutorial, I will show how to prepare `input` files and run ANOVA and Tukey test in R software. For detailed information on ANOVA and R, please read this article at this 
<a href="https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32/anova-compare-more-than-two-groups">link</a>. 

<h1> Step 1: Preparing the Input file </h1>
Create an input file as shown in the example below:

<hr>

<center><h1> Step 2: Run ANOVA in R</h1></center>
<hr>
<h3> 2.1 Import R package </h3>

Install R package `agricolae` and open the library typing the below command line:
```
library(agricolae)
```

<hr>
<h3> 2.2 Import data </h3>

Import your data by typing the below command line:
```
data= read.table(file = "fileName.txt", header = T)
```

<hr>
<h3> 2.3 Check data </h3>

Once the data is imported, check it by typing the below command line:
```
head(data_pressure)
tail(data_pressure)
```

<hr>
<h3> 2.4 Conduct ANOVA </h3>

Now, Simply run `ANOVA` by by typing the below command lines:
```
data.lm <- lm(data$Dependent_variable ~ data$Treatment, data = data)

data.av <- aov(data.lm)
summary(data.av)
```

The results should look similar as seen below:
```
> summary(data.av)
               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    
data$Treatment  3  139.2   46.38   38.49 1.69e-08 ***
Residuals      20   24.1    1.20                     
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

From the summary output, one can interpret that there is a significant difference (i.e. P < 0.001) between the `Treatments`, however, we perfom Tukey's Test to investigate the differences between all treaments using steps below.

<hr>
<h3> 3.0 Conduct Tukey test </h3>
Type below commands to run Tukey test:
```
data.test <- TukeyHSD(data.av)
data.test
```

Below is the summary of the Tukey test:
```
> data.test
  Tukey multiple comparisons of means
    95% family-wise confidence level

Fit: aov(formula = data.lm)

$`data$Treatment`
           diff        lwr      upr     p adj
B-A  2.52666667  0.7527896 4.300544 0.0037260
D-A  5.74500000  3.9711229 7.518877 0.0000001
E-A  5.72583333  3.9519563 7.499710 0.0000001
D-B  3.21833333  1.4444563 4.992210 0.0003106
E-B  3.19916667  1.4252896 4.973044 0.0003326
E-D -0.01916667 -1.7930437 1.754710 0.9999897
```

From the above T-test, one can interpret that there is a significant difference most of groups, except between-groups __E-D__ at P <0.001

Finally, one can plot the above results using the below command:
```
plot(data.test)
```
