  Hi! My name is Avinash Karn, I go by <strong>Avi</strong>. I am very passionate about plants and cutting-edge technology. I have in-depth knowledge and a rigorous hands on experience in the field of plant breeding, quantitative genetics, computational biology and high-throughput phenotyping for over 10 years now, which I earned during my research work with plant breeders/geneticists, bioinformaticists, pathologist in my undergraduate, graduate and my postdoctoral career here in the United States. I am a creative project leader and cross-functional collaborator with an ability to excel in multifaceted fast-paced teams as evident from collaborations with different breeding teams 5 published manuscripts in high impact scientific journals and 9 in preparation, 10+ oral presentations. I intend to use my education and training in pursuing a career in an organization that is involved to improve human nutrition, health and environment for both developed and developing communities. Finally, Some of my hobbies include astronomy, painting, stamp collecting, online blogging/writing, photography and cooking! ðŸ˜‰

### 2012â€”2017 Graduate Research Assistant (PhD) - University of Missouri Columbia, USA

Involved in the development of novel genetic resource and mapping populations such as near isogenic and synthetic lines derived from domesticated corn and its wild relative, Teosinte. Conducted `Joint linkage QTL analysis` and Genome wide association study to elucidate several aspects of genetic diversity in maize; genetic basis of various agronomic, fitness and yield related traits such as seed quality and composition in trials conducted with multiple replications in different environment and year. Investigated gene by gene epistatic interactions for various adaptation and domestication related traits in trials with multiple replications and environment.

Assisted in preparing summer maize nurseries such as plowing field with a tractor, planting seeds with hand and dumping seed in seed planter, pollinating and collecting various agronomic data from field trials, harvesting and analyzing data. Developed gene specific molecular markers to select alleles responsible for high amylose in maize kernels with better yield, which I validated their stability in trials conducted in multiple replications in different environments. Wrote annual USDA-ARS Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) report and presented at ASTA meeting in Chicago, Illinois. 

### 2008-2012 Cafeteria student worker - Sodexo Inc. , USA
Served and stocked food as well as performed all the cleaning related activities in the cafeteria.

### 2011-2012 Comparative genomics researcher - Truman State University, USA
Bioinformatic analysis of the intra-genomic evolution of retained homeologous paralogs in maize. This project attempted to create a model undergraduate genome annotation community. An examination of approximately eight million base pairs of the maize genome was conducted using bioinformatic tools including: genome browsers (MaizeGDB and MaizeSequence.org), gene expression databases (PlexDB), protein functional prediction software (InterProScan. FGENESH) and comparative genome platforms (CoGe). Also, the consistency of the functional annotations with the balanced gene drive model and exhibition of subgenome bias in the retention/decay, gene density, and expression patterns of homeologous paralog pairs were also evaluated in the study.

### Summer 2009 & 2012 NSF TruScholars Research Program - Truman State University, USA
Designed gene specific molecular marker for a novel of starch branching enzyme Ia (SBE-1a) allele involved in high amylose starch in maize. Discovered novel recessive starch branching enzyme 1a (sbe1a) likely plays a significant role in the presence of the ae allele in elevating starch amylose from ~55% to >70% in the germplasm release 'GEMS-0067'. Conducted linkage based mapping studies to identify QTLs for high amylose starch in maize using SSR markers and `QTL cartographer` software. Sequenced starch branching enzyme allele (SBE1a) from high amylose maize line, GEMS-0067; Discovered 8bp insertion site at intron 9 resulting splicing mutation, which putatively resulted in truncated protein product post-translation.
