I am a passionate `plant quantitative geneticits` and `computational biologist`. My hobbies include astronomy, painting, online blogging, photography, cooking, fixing things around my house :) and working on my car. I have over ten years of research experience in the field of plant breeding, quantitative genetics and high-throughput phenotyping, and possess a strong knowledge and experience in conducting big data analysis and visualization especially on a large scale phenotypic and genotypic data.

#### 2018–Present Computational biologist (Postdoc) — Cornell University, Geneva, NY

Analyzed large-scale genotyping data such as `Genotyping-by-Sequencing`, `Amplicon Sequencing`, `Illumina resequencing`, and/or `PacBio de novo sequencing`) such as `SNP` and `Haplotype calling`. Developed `genetic markers` for traits like powdery mildew disease resistance and fruit quality, to assist breeders with `marker assisted selection`; conducted statistical analysis of large-scale data sets from DNA sequencing and trait data from related and unrelated vines for `genetic mapping` in Lep-MAP3, `QTL mapping` in R, `genome wide association studies` in TASSEL/FarmCPU/GAPIT. Managed grapevine breeding database www.VitisBase.org , and led setting up trials and phenotype data collection on `Field Book` android application.

#### 2017 May–2017 Dec Quantitative Geneticist (Postdoc) — University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign, IL

Led and managed undergraduate students and technicians in the installation of over 2,000 `minirhizotron` tubes in field to image and study maize roots with `Bartz imaging systems`; and collections of minirhizotron images, moisture data, flowering, above ground biomass and yield harvest. Identified genetics basis for maize root structure and control of plant nutrient relations in Illinois Protein Strain Recombinant Inbred (IPSRI) lines of maize

#### 2012—2017 Graduate Research Assistant (PhD) - University of Missouri Columbia, USA

Involved in the development of novel genetic resource and mapping populations such as near isogenic and synthetic lines derived from domesticated corn and its wild relative, Teosinte. Conducted `Joint linkage QTL analysis` and Genome wide association study to elucidate several aspects of genetic diversity in maize; genetic basis of various agronomic, fitness and yield related traits such as seed quality and composition in trials conducted with multiple replications in different environment and year. Investigated gene by gene epistatic interactions for various adaptation and domestication related traits in trials with multiple replications and environment.

#### 2009-2012 Undergraduate Research Assistant (BSc) - Truman State University, USA
Conducted molecular genetic analysis to exploit the biodiversity of exotic inbred lines from Central and South America to develop high amylose corn using SSR markers and gel electrophoresis. Assisted in preparing summer maize nurseries such as plowing field with a tractor, planting seeds with hand and dumping seed in seed planter, pollinating and collecting various agronomic data from field trials, harvesting and analyzing data. Developed gene specific molecular markers to select alleles responsible for high amylose in maize kernels with better yield, which I validated their stability in trials conducted in multiple replications in different environments. Wrote annual USDA-ARS Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) report and presented at ASTA meeting in Chicago, Illinois. 

#### 2008-2012 Cafeteria student worker - Sodexo Inc. , USA
Served and stocked food as well as performed all the cleaning related activities in the cafeteria.

#### 2011-2012 Comparative genomics researcher - Truman State University, USA
Analyzed retained homeologous paralog pairs from syntenic regions in Maize and Sorghum. Visualized genomic data of approximately 1Mb in size in `CIRCOS`, and conducted comparative genetic study in online tools such as `GeVo function in CoGe`, Annotated genes using `InterProScan` and expression analysis data from `Plexdb.org`

#### Summer 2009 & 2012 NSF TruScholars Research Program - Truman State University, USA
Designed gene specific molecular marker for a novel of starch branching enzyme Ia (SBE-1a) allele involved in high amylose starch in maize. Discovered novel recessive starch branching enzyme 1a (sbe1a) likely plays a significant role in the presence of the ae allele in elevating starch amylose from ~55% to >70% in the germplasm release 'GEMS-0067'. Conducted linkage based mapping studies to identify QTLs for high amylose starch in maize using SSR markers and `QTL cartographer` software. Sequenced starch branching enzyme allele (SBE1a) from high amylose maize line, GEMS-0067; Discovered 8bp insertion site at intron 9 resulting splicing mutation, which putatively resulted in truncated protein product post-translation.
